It's an Extension to calculate the global latency from all locations of the current [ping.sx](https://ping.sx) page.

## Features

- **Global summary** — mean, median, and p95 of the average latency across every location, plus mean last/best/worst, all colour-coded by health.
- **Live updates** — statistics refresh automatically as ping results stream in.
- **Highest-latency list** — see the top 5, 10, or 15 slowest locations, with an inline latency bar per node. Your choice is remembered across sessions.
- **Snapshot & compare** — save a run as a baseline, then compare later runs against it to see per-metric and per-location deltas (improved values in green, worse in red). New and removed locations are tagged.
- **Export** — download the per-location data as CSV or JSON, or refresh on demand.

## Usage

1. Visit the [Ping.sx Overview](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ping-sx-overview/) add-on page and add it to your browser.
2. Open a `ping.sx` ping page, for example [ping.sx/ping?t=1.1.1.1](https://ping.sx/ping?t=1.1.1.1), and let the results load.
3. With that tab active, click the extension icon in the toolbar or extension list to see the statistics.

To compare two runs, click **Save** to store the current run as a baseline, run your ping again (or change something and re-run), then turn on the **Compare** toggle to view the differences.
